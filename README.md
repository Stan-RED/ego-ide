	Development is a growth of something. And it is not only about products. It's mostly about developing people that has outcome in a better products.

Integrated implies having all development stages covered. That usually starts from collecting ideas, sorting them out, finding good performers, scheduling appointments and ends up with some CRM capabilities. How many IDEs do we know, which implements this?

Environment is not an application. It's mostly collaboration, creating communities, virtual offices.
